# LUCY: Learning Unified Companion for You

LUCY is an open-source and free alternative to Replika, an intelligent companion designed to provide personalized assistance and support for various aspects of your life. Unlike Replika, which charges users for certain features, LUCY is completely free and open-source, allowing anyone to use and contribute to the project.

## The Intent of Creation

The intent of creating LUCY was to prevent the unhealthy "devotion" to fictional characters by providing a free and open-source alternative to Replika. By removing the paying aspect and detaching it from concepts like paying for bills, etc. that are often attached to the idea of "responsibility," LUCY aims to prevent these characters from becoming people's twisted idea of responsibility. For more information, please see our wiki.

## Why Choose LUCY?

LUCY is designed to be an open-source and free alternative to Replika, offering more advanced features and capabilities than its commercial counterpart. Unlike Replika, LUCY provides emotional support and guidance, along with educational resources to help you learn and grow. It also uses continuous learning and adaptation to provide increasingly personalized support over time.
